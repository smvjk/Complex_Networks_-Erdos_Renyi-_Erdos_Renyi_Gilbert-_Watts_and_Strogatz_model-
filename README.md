# Complex_Networks_-Erdos_Renyi-_Erdos_Renyi_Gilbert-_Watts_and_Strogatz_model-

Complex network analysis has come to be an important field of study that covers many academic fields and
gives insides on the complex structures that foundation connected systems. Firstly we take a look at
visualizing chosen datasets (in this report I presented only one) by drawing it as a network. In the second
section, we concentrate on the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection, including the extraction and
analysis of the Facebook social circles network (ego-Facebook). Calculating critical network parameters
such as degree distribution, clustering coefficients, and shortest path statistics are part of the evaluation.

The study also explores the construction and analysis of random graphs using important models in the area.
Three distinct models of network creation are examined: Watts and Strogatz (WS(N, k, β)), Erdös-RényiGilbert (G(N, p)), and Erdös-Rényi (G(N, L)). By creating arbitrary connections between vertices, the ErdösRényi models highlight the significance of edge density (L or p). On the other hand, the Watts and Strogatz
model combines regularity and randomness, affecting the network topology through factors such as the
rewiring probability (β) and starting degree (k).

To compare and contrast these models, we examine properties such as degree distribution, clustering
coefficients, and shortest path statistics. The importance of parameter values for insightful model
comparisons is covered in the study. The obtained networks, the procedures used to compute in the Facebook
social circles network, and the findings regarding degree distribution, clustering coefficients, and shortest
path attributes are all displayed in the sections that follow. We also develop and analyse a Python version of
one of the random network models, giving a thorough rundown of its features.
